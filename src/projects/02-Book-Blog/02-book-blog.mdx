### Book Blog

[Github Code](https://github.com/LaurenwallerDesigns/book-blog)

I have wanted to do this for awhile. I started listening to books during the pandemic and wanted to have documentation of my thoughts and feelings about each book. But I didn't want to add my unremarkable ramblings to Goodreads. Thus the book blog was born.
