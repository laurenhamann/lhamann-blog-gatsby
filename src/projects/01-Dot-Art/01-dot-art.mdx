### Dot Art 


[Github Code](https://github.com/LaurenwallerDesigns/dot-game)

A little design project I created when starting out with React. <br />
I wanted to do something that reminded me of when you would turn on your computer as a kid but someone was on the phone so you couldn't connect to the internet so you would just open Paint until you could go onto Neopets.
