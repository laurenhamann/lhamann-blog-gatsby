### Mood Board Website

This project is a lightbulb idea, that came to me after using shortcuts on IOS. I made a shortcut that would take my mood from a list and add to a text file. My site then takes that file and automatically parses into JSON. My frontend takes that JSON and renders it. Using a bit of RegEx, I am able to color the correct pixel for each day and month. I am very excited about this project!
